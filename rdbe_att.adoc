= DRAFT Method for setting attenuation for RDBEs
E. Himwich, C. Ruszczyk, K. Imai, C. Coughlin, M. Poirier, A. Burns, E. Terrazas
Version 0.93 - October 2021

:sectnums:

== Introduction

The <<Method>> section below can be used to adjust the attenuation
settings depending on the observing mode. The observing mode usually
stays the same for a given experiment type. It is not currently
possible to change the mode in an experiment from the schedule file.
When that becomes possible, each mode can supply its own attenuator
settings. Additionally, please be aware that more than one experiment
type may use the same mode.

Before a new observing mode is used at a station for the first time,
the method given here can be used to adjust the attenuation and then
the Coordinating Center can be informed of the correct settings to use
in future schedules for that experiment type or observing mode. The
determined values can be used locally until the schedules received are
using them as the default.

If the method has not been attempted yet for some observing modes that
a station is already using, it should be performed for those modes and
the Coordinating Center informed of any changes that are needed.

If there are changes at a station, an update may be necessary. This
is described in the next section <<Dealing with changes>>.

== Dealing with changes

Due to changes in the situation at a station, e.g., having a warm
receiver or a loss of signal chain gain, it may become necessary to
adjust the values. If not otherwise apparent, this may become evident
because the RDBE RMSs are not reaching the target value, typically
about `20`.

At that point, the method can be re-run or an appropriate _ad hoc_
change to the values can be used to correct the situation. As an
example of the latter approach, an increase in the overall signal
level of 10 dB might be compensated for by increasing the RFD and/or
UDC attenuations by a net total of 10 dB. Of course, if this is caused
by a failure of some component, the failure should be addressed as
soon as practical.

Once the level is corrected, it should be considered whether the issue
is likely to continue long enough for it to be worth sending new
values to the Coordinating Center or to just adjust the values locally
until the issue is resolved. If a change only affects one experiment,
it may not be worth sending the new values to the Coordinating Center.
Instead the change can just be made directly in the `ifdbb` procedure
for that experiment. That approach can be followed for some time, but
eventually it may be better to send an updated `ifdbb` procedure to
the Coordinating Center so it can be included in schedules
automatically rather than adjusting it each time at the station.

If a new `ifdbb` procedure is developed, it can be inserted into
schedules locally using the method in
<<Updating the ifdbb procedure in a schedule locally>> section below.

If it is worth sending the updated version to the Coordinating Center,
the method in
<<Sending an updated ifdbb for use by schedule writers>> section below
can be used. This is appropriate for permanent or long lasting
changes, reducing the amount of manual work needed at the station.

If the attenuation settings are determined using the <<Method>>
section below, resulting in RDBE attenuator values of 10-15 dB, the
system should be able to tolerate level changes of in a range of up to
about Â±10 dB fairly well in the short-term, including weather.
However, it is recommended that this not be used as a band-aid for a
long-term problem.

== How attenuations interact

The total attenuation for each IF signal is the sum of the RFD, UDC,
and RDBE attenuation in the signal path for that IF channel. For a
given signal level and RFD and UDC attenuation settings, the RDBE will
try to adjust its attenuation to reach the nominal RMS, usually `20`,
in each channel.

Suppose that has happened, i.e., the RMS has adjusted to `20`. Then
the total of the attenuation for that channel has reached the right
level to get `20` as the RMS level. Let's say that the attenuations
are RFD: `20`, UDC: `15`, and RDBE: `15`. This gives a total
attenuation of `50` dB.

Now suppose that the UDC attenuation for that IF is increased by 5 dB.
To get an RMS of `20`, the RDBE will have to reduce its attenuation by
about the same amount. Now the attenuations would be about RFD: `20`,
UDC: `20`, and RDBE: `10`. The total is still 50 dB, but it is
distributed differently. This is also an example of the fact that the
RDBE attenuation changes in the opposite direction of the RFD plus UDC
attenuation. What is being held constant is the RMS of `20` (assuming
it is possible to get to `20`).

== Method

The basic strategy is to adjust the RFD and UDC attenuators to get the
RDBE RMSs around `20`, working at zenith on a clear day. Then the
attenuator settings are further refined to get the RDBE attenuations
in the `10`-`15` dB range.

The description in this section provides a lot of detail to assist
users that are attempting this for the first time. More experienced
users may not need so much detail, but may still find it useful for
reference. To help illustrate what is involved, two appendices are
included, <<Example ifdbb procedure>> and
<<Example rdbe_atten= output>>.

All steps should be performed as _oper_.

. Point the antenna to zenith on a clear day (hopefully there is not a
lot of RFI).

. In the FS, open a procedure library for an experiment of the type
that you want to make adjustments for, e.g. for a `vo` at `K2`:

+
    proc=vo0202k2

. Using _pfmed_, make a copy of `ifdbb`, maybe `ifdt`. In _pfmed_:

    st,ifdbb,ifdt
    ex

+

IMPORTANT: You _must_ use _pfmed_ to modify procedures to keep them in
sync with the FS. Help is available in _pfmed_ with the `help`
command. Commands support tab-completion where it is useful.

. Use _pfmed_ to make changes to the attenuation settings in `ifdt`
for these steps:

+

CAUTION: You must exit _pfmed_ each time you make a change before
re-executing the procedure to test the effect. Use the `ex` commands
to exit _pfmed_.

+

[TIP]
====

You can use the _pfmed_ `vi` command to edit the procedure with _vi_,
e.g., `vi,ifdt`. This will also work for _emacs_ with `emacs,ifdt`. If
you would like to use a different editor you can specify it by setting
the `EDITOR` environment variable. For example to use _nano_, you can
use:

 export EDITOR=nano

before you enter _pfmed_ (this is only needed once per window, or text
terminal login, instance; it could be added to _~oper/.profile_ for
use in future logins). Then use the `ed,ifdt` command inside _pfmed_
to edit the procedure with your specified editor.

====

+

.. Set all RFD attenuators to `10`

+

NOTE: If you don't have an RFD, set any attenuation before the RDBEs
appropriately. In this case, a good starting UDC attention might be
`20`. Use the value you choose in place of the `10` in the next step.

.. Set all UDC attenuators to `10`

.. Iterate the following steps to get nominal RMSs of `20`:

... Check the RMS values for the current `ifdt` setup:


    ifdt
    rdbe_atten=

+

TIP: `help=rdbe_atten` will display a help page for `rdbe_atten`
command that explains what it does and its output.

... If the RMSs are too high, increase individual UDC attenuators to
get the RMSs closer to  `20` (if too low, decrease the UDC
attenuators).

+

If a UDC attenuator is near its maximum, `31.5`, increase the
corresponding RFD attenuator by `10` (or `5`) dB and try again (if the
UDC attenuation is near `0` decrease the RFD attenuation instead).

+

[NOTE]
====

Adjusting the RFD attenuation may affect other channels. If this
happens to you, you may need to trim their UDC settings again. The
typical correspondence of RFD channels to UDCs/IFs is given in the
<<rfdchannels,RFD Channels>> table. This table can be used to
determine which IFs are affected by which RFD and UDC channels.

.RFD Channels
[[rfdchannels]]
[cols="^,^,^,^"]
|===
| RFD Channel | Signal |UDC Channel|RDBE IF

|  0|       H-pol Low|A-0| A-0
|  1|       V-pol Low|A-1| A-1
|  2|       H-pol High|BCD-0| BCD-0
|  3|       V-pol High|BCD-1|BCD-1
|===
====

+

.. Once all RMS are nominal (typically
~`20`), look at the RDBE attenuator values. Use the same iterative
steps as above to adjust the UDC attenuators to put the RDBE
attenuators in the range `10`-`15` if possible.

+

TIP: Increasing the sum of RFD and UDC attenuation will cause the RDBE
attenuation to decrease (and vice-versa) to reach an RMS of `20`.

+

TIP: It is desirable to get the RFD and UDC attenuators in the middle
of their ranges to the extent possible, consistent with the RDBE
attenuation being in the `10`-`15` dB range. The RFD and UDC attenuators
have a range of `0`-`31.5` dB (in `0.5` dB steps).

+

NOTE: There are usually fixed attenuators before the RFD (or UDC, if
you don't have an RFD) that could be changed, but that is better
avoided unless absolutely necessary.

+

. When finished, prepare a new procedure library with just your
updated procedure. You can use a library name of your choosing, but
make the final procedure name `ifdbb`. In the example below, the new
procedure library is `voattk2` (`vo` for the experiment type, `att`
for attenuation, and `k2` as the station two-letter code). The example
also assumes you used `ifdt` as the name of your test procedure and
that you were working with procedure library `vo0202k2` to begin with.
Please adjust the names as needed. In _pfmed_:

+

....
pfcr,voattk2
pf,voattk2
st,ifdt::vo0202k2,ifdbb
ex
....

. Consider whether to use the updated procedure locally and/or send it
to the Coordinating Center for use in future experiments. Those
actions are described in the next two sections, in that order.

== Updating the ifdbb procedure in a schedule locally

You can use a new `ifdbb` procedure in any schedules of the
appropriate type if schedule writers have not started using the new
version yet. The example below uses the names from the <<Method>>
section above. All steps in this section should be executed as _oper_.

This step uses the _new_ifdbb_ script. A listing of this script and a
link to a copy are provided in the appendix <<new_ifdbb script>>.
This script takes three arguments:

[%noheader]
[frame=none,grid=none]
[cols="1,4"]

|===
|_procedure file_|
The procedure file containing _just_ the new _ifdbb_ procedure.

|_station name_|
This is the station name used in the _.skd_ file.

|_schedule file_|
The _.skd_ schedule file that will be updated.
|===

For example, for the new procedure library created in the example at
in the <<Method>> section above, `voattk2`, station `KOKEE12M`, and
schedule _vo0202.skd_, use the commands:

....
cd /usr2/sched
new_ifdbb ../proc/voattk2.prc KOKEE12M vo0202.skd
....

NOTE: If your version of the FS does not have _new_ifdbb_ (it was
added in version _10.0.0_), you can use a copy that has been placed in
the _~oper_ directory as _new_ifdbb_ and made executable with `*chmod
a+x ~/new_ifdbb*`.

You will then need to regenerate the SNAP procedures with _drudg_. Make
sure the procedure file is not open in the FS, or that the FS is not
running, then execute:

....
cd /usr2/sched
drudg vo0202.skd
....

In response to the prompts:

. Enter your station code (`K2` for our example).
. Select option `12` to generate the procedures.
. Answer `y` if requested to confirm purging the existing procedure file.`
. Enter `0` to exit `drudg`.

You can verify that the correct values have been inserted by opening
the procedure library in the FS and using `ifdbb` to set the IFs up
and `rdbe_atten=` to adjust the RDBE levels. You should get
results that match your changes, presumably with RMSs around `20` with
the RDBE attenuators in the range `10`-`15` dB.

TIP: You can also check that the change in the `.skd` file using the
`diff` command, as described in the appendix
<<Example diff output comparing schedule files>> below.

== Sending an updated ifdbb for use by schedule writers

For long term changes, you can send a library with a new `ifdbb`
procedure (`/usr2/proc/voattk2.prc` for the example in the <<Method>>
section above) as a file attachment to the IVS Coordinating Center for
use in future schedules. Please include the experiment type(s)/mode(s)
it is to be used for in your message.

[appendix]

= Example ifdbb procedure

The following is a listing of the `ifdbb` procedure that was developed
for KPGO 12m for `vo` and `v2` experiments, using this procedure.
This will not be the right procedure in every detail for other stations
or observing modes. It is just offered as an example.

= Example rdbe_atten= output

The following is an example log display output for the `rdbe_atten=`
command (as invoked by the SNAP `auto` procedure, which is used four
times) from the KPGO 12m using the example `ifdbb` procedure in the
appendix <<Example ifdbb procedure>>.

There are three things to notice here:

. The attenuator settings are all approximately in the `10`-`15` dB
range.

. The RMSs are all about `20`.

. There is some time variation in the attenuator and RMS values. This
is normal. Large time varying RFI may significantly increase the
variation.

= Example diff output comparing schedule files

You can use the _diff_ command to compare the result of _new_ifdbb_
script to the original schedule. Working with the examples in this
document, the following commands can be used:

....
cd /usr2/sched
diff vo0202.skd vo0202.skd.bak
....

In the following output generated from these commands, please note that:

. Only lines that changed are shown.

. Lines from the updated schedule (the first file in the _diff_
command) are preceded by `<`; lines from the old schedule (second
file), `>`.

. Except for the `define` line (which may or not have changed),
only lines that set attenuators have changed. In particular, no lines
that refer to LO settings are shown as changed. Some attenuator
setting lines may not be shown if they didn't change.

. The station for which the change was made is not visible. However,
if you used your station name with _new_ifdbb_, the change was for
your station. You can also verify that you have updated the procedure
for your station by testing the new `ifdbb` procedure as described at
the end of the <<Updating the ifdbb procedure in a schedule locally>>
section above. Alternatively, you can list it from a newly generated
procedure library (_vo0202k2.prc_ for the example) in _pfmed_ (use the
`li` command) to see if you get the updated version. The method for
regenerating the library is also described in the same section above.
